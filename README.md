06-18-2020 4:15 - Application has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. It is grabbing the data from the location.json file. Response request cycle.

Lab-08 | Feature #2 | Server

- Server checks communicates to database to check for queried location, if the data is there, it is sent to the client. Otherwise, the server will make a call to the API and then send the response to the client for proper rendering.

- Server is recieving a request from the front end based on the users query, sends a request to the api, gets a response, and then sends it back the the front end to be rendered by the client.
